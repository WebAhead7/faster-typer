<h4> What Is Touch Typing?</h4>
Touch typing is the ability to use muscle memory to find keys fast, without using the sense of sight, and with all the available fingers, <br>just like piano players do. It significantly improves typing speed and eliminates errors. Touch typing simply makes you more productive<br> and it is a skill worth learning. However, many people engage in the bad habit of ‘hunt-and-peck’ typing, even those seasoned professionals with <br>years and decades of computer experience. It  is easy to understand,
though, as touch typing requires dedicated practice to learn it well.
